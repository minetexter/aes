The primary motivation is to assist students in writing essays by giving them a formulaic breakdown of what the key components are in a question. The output should be something that shows them what the key topics are and what keywords to pay attention to at the basic level. This problem can be reduced to data wrangling if we have a known set of potential words that are in the question (which is a safe assumption). However since the questions can vary considerably we should have some engine which highlights the “important” (perhaps from training sample) areas and also at an advanced level, gives a rough structure for an essay plan. This plan would then serve students to know they are on the right track before wasting time on perfecting the analytical parts of economics. Ultimately it needs to serve students, doesn’t matter if use fancy AI or not.

An interesting side project which could mirror this is to auto grade essays. I think this should be easier to tackle as it doesn’t require “customer satisfaction”.
